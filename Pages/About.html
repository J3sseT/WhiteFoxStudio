            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <aside>
                <p>Hey there! I’m Jo– a photographer &amp; graphic designer based in a small town near Berlin, Germany – and I am so excited for you to be here!</p> 
                <p>
                I have enjoyed and experimented with Camera all my life, but it wasn’t until I went to the US as an EduCare that I realized my passion for</p> 
                <p>creative work runs more profound than for it to be just a hobby. </p>
                <br>
                <p>While being an EduCare, I visited a local College and fell in love with the photography classes.</p>
                <p>Since then, I have been photographing different events and portraits and working with various clients on studio projects.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I like to think I take a different approach when shooting content. Good photographers come into a project knowing the type of shots they want.<p/>
                <p> While this is important, I’ve learned to take what we’ve discussed and creatively develop a story to harmonize with your unique vision.</p>
                <p>The goal is to capture everything in its purest form for that I catch the essence of the moment forever.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I tackle each project with impeccable care and a meticulous eye for detail to ensure that each dimension of your vision,</p>
                <p>dream, and memorable day is brought to life… I’m lucky to have something that brings so much happiness into my life,</p>
                <p>and this is my small way of sharing that happiness back with the world.</p>
